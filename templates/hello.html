         Case 1: Data has been submitted (Post Request)
         
         If data exists, the page has been submitted (posted) to the server
         by the user having submitted the form. In real-world applications,
         a variety of validations of the form data usually exists, but here
         we will optimistically just take data from the form as it is.
         
         However, even in a simple project, you will probably need to do some
         basic validation of the most import data - for instance, if you are
         creating a chart based on a user selection, at minimum the selection 
         must not be null or empty and the selection must be a valid item that 
         can be charted... in other words, cover the basic things that can "go wrong" -->
    
    {% if data %}
    
      {% if data.message %}
        <h1>Hi, {{ data.message }}!</h1>
      {% else %}
        <h1>You did not enter a name. That's okay - welcome anyway!</h1>
      {% endif %}
      
    <!-- 
        Case 2: No data yet (Get Request)
         If no data exists, the page has been requested for the first time
         so just display the form and whatever else you want to initially show the 
         user when they first open the page.

         This is an "old-fashioned" way of doing this - we simply use the same
         page to either display a blank form ready to be filled in, or a page
         with the form data being used for whatever purpose - but either way
         it is the same page. It simply behaves different depending on whether
         it is a get request (without data) or a post request (with data).

         Another option is for the application to go to a different page when
         the form is submitted - in this case, you set your action attribute
         to the page you want to redirect to, and submit the form to that page.

        <input type="text" name="name" class="m-2"></input>
        
        <!-- Submit (OK, Enter, Post) button -->
        <button type="submit" class="d-block">Submit</input>
      
      </form>
